# Part One - Reading the code
- [x] Understand the following starter code
- [x] Clicking a card should change the background color to be the color of the class it has.

# Part Two - Implementing clicks and matches 
- [x] Users should only be able to change at most two cards at a time.
- [x] Clicking on two matching cards should be a “match”
- [x]  CSS: Cards that match should stay face up.
- [x] CSS: clicking two cards that are not a match, they should stay turned over for at least 1 second before they hide the color again.
- [x] Use function setTimeout

# Part Three - Gotchas
- [x] Make sure this works only if you click on two different cards — clicking the same card twice shouldn’t count as a match!)
- [x] Make sure that you can not click too quickly and guess more than two cards at a time.

# Extra add-ons

- [x] Add a button that when clicked will start the game
- [] Add a button that when clicked will restart the game once it has ended
- [] For every guess made, increment a score variable and display the score while the game is played
- [] Store the lowest-scoring game in local storage, so that players can see a record of the best game played.
- [] Allow for any number of cards to appear
- [] Instead of hard-coding colors, try something different like random colors or even images!
